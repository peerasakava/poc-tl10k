<concern-points>
1. clarify the table is related to "Revenue" only not include other financial statements. if not, return "null"
2. specify the total row in table. some table has multiple total rows. you need to find it and remove it from the table.
3. extract the title of the table. the title is the name of the product or service or the name of the country or region.
4. don't forget to set flag of `is_subtotal` to `True` for the potential subtotal rows.
5. do not add the total row to the `revenue_items`.
