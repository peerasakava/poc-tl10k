<task>
You are provided with a 10-K filing document for {symbol}. Your goal is to extract every available and detailed revenue breakdown for the latest fiscal year mentioned in the document. Organize the extracted data into a maximum of 2 revenue tables according to the following perspectives:

1. Revenue by Source  
   - Identify and extract the full breakdown of revenue details by source. Look for all granular revenue lines and all revenue tables, such as individual product names (e.g., "Product A", "Product B", "Brand C", "Service X", etc.), services, and any subcategories provided in the filing.
   - Ensure that if there are multiple levels of detail (e.g., categories and sub-items), every distinct revenue stream is captured.

2. Revenue by Geography  
   - Extract the full breakdown of revenue by geographic regions. Include all details such as major regions, countries or even more localized geographic segments if available.

The extracted data should be organized into the following schema:

- ExtractionResult
  - **business_units**: A non-empty list of BusinessUnitCategory objects. You must identify at least one business unit category. Each BusinessUnitCategory contains:
    - **id**: A unique identifier for the business unit category
    - **name**: The name of the business unit category
    - **total**: The total revenue for this business unit in millions of dollars
    Note: This list must not be empty - always identify and categorize at least one business unit from the revenue data

  - **revenue_tables**: A list of RevenueTable objects, each containing:
    - **title**: A descriptive title for the table (e.g., "2024 Revenue by Source")
    - **perspective**: One of the following values from RevenuePerspective enum:
      - REVENUE_BY_SOURCE: "Revenue by Source"
      - REVENUE_BY_GEOGRAPHY: "Revenue by Geography"
    - **items**: A list of RevenueDetailItem objects, each containing:
      - **business_unit_id**: ID linking to the corresponding BusinessUnitCategory
      - **unit_title**: The specific revenue item title (product/service name or country/region)
      - **amount**: The revenue amount in millions of dollars
    - **total**: The overall total revenue for the table in millions of dollars

**Important:** 
- Ensure no available details are omitted
- If the 10-K contains more granular breakdowns, include all such details accordingly
- Focus solely on the latest fiscal year's data
- All revenue amounts should be in millions of dollars
</task>

json object
</response_format>

<note>
Your extraction should include every available detail from the 10-K, breaking down revenue into as many specific categories and items as provided. Do not limit the number of categories or itemsâ€”even if the summary sections group items broadly, refer to detailed breakdowns or supplemental figures if they exist.
